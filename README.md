# Fruities
This project was built with the concept of creating a simple API that would navigate users to a page with nutruaitonal fruit facts upon selection they made from our drop-down box. 

## How It's Made:
  Programming this simple API included the following:
  * Select class to create a dropbox menu containing fruit options
  * A button type for the "Submit" button
  * <P> ,<span>, and headings were element's used to provide content
  * <img> to display image of fruit selected by user 
  * used function search & methods as open(), request() and onload() 
  * Incorporated conditionals 
  * Used localhost:8000 
  


**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, Front End Vanilla JS, back end JS (Node), 

## Lessons Learned:

With more practice I find it easier to create simple API's without scripting it in the HTML file. As well it's crucial to know when spacing is going to affect your code.
